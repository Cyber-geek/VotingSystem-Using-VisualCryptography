# VotingSystem-Using-VisualCryptography

Online voting system has the facility to complete voting process faster than the paper
ballot voting procedure. This system itself should be intelligent to earn the trust and
confidence of the user by providing enhanced security and reliability. The security is
an important factor in any voting system.

However, the problem with this is that any user can log in to the website and cast votes
multiple times using various identities which leads to unfair election result.
This is a frequently encountered issue with the online voting system which is
deteriorating the authenticity of the decisions taken via the online mode.So security is 
provided through the authentication. Authentication is a secured way to check the voterâ€™s identity. 

The principal objective of authentication is to prevent any adversary from copying other user. 
Secret sharing schemes are the powerful mechanism used for the authentication.
Secret sharing schemes are ideal for storing information that is highly sensitive and
highly important. Secret sharing is also termed as secret splitting. Secret sharing is a
method for allocating a secret among a group of participants. Each of whom is allocated
a share of the secret.

In this project I have implemented a two factor authentication system through which a
voter can vote by passing through biometrics and VC share mechanism which facilitates
authentication as well identification of a genuine voter.
